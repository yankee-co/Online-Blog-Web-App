app and then modified for being able to 
work within used framework.
Built in Django logic was used to create an 
admin system for managing the blog, that 
includes using integrated Django database 
for storing data.

## Some functionality for example
and how it looks and work

_First of all, admin user must be 
created. First admin is created by 
programmer, which can be used then 
to create and configure another 
users, uncluding other admins_

_Then it can be used to manage posts, users, add or remove categories, etc._

_Click on post would open it’s full page version
with all the data provided in the post

As any post need the author and categories to be mentioned, all of it was 
created before and existing user was chosen as an author_
